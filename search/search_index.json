This tutorial will guide you through creating your first beautiful, professional-quality container candle using natural soy wax. Before You Start Prerequisites : - Read and understand Safety Protocols - Have all required tools ready - Set up safe workspace with proper ventilation - Allow 2-3 hours for complete process (including cooling time) What You'll Create \u00b6 By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a beautiful 8 oz soy wax candle that: Burns cleanly and evenly for 40-50 hours Has excellent scent throw throughout the room Looks professional and gift-worthy Demonstrates all fundamental candle making techniques Materials Needed \u00b6 Wax and Wick \u00b6 6 oz soy wax flakes (we'll make an 8 oz candle with ~6 oz of wax) 1 medium cotton wick (ECO-10 or CD-12 recommended for 3\" diameter container) 1 wick sticker (small adhesive dot to secure wick) Container and Fragrance \u00b6 8 oz glass jar (3\" diameter opening ideal) 0.5 oz fragrance oil (about 1 tablespoon - 8% fragrance load) Optional: Candle dye (2-3 drops liquid or small chip of block dye) Tools \u00b6 Double boiler setup (large pot + smaller pot/pitcher) Digital thermometer (instant-read type) Kitchen scale (for precise measurements) Wooden spoon or stirring stick Wick centering device (pencils/clothespins work) Heat gun or hair dryer (for smoothing top) Step-by-Step Instructions \u00b6 Step 1: Workspace Preparation (5 minutes) \u00b6 Clear and clean your workspace Remove all clutter and flammable materials Wipe down surfaces Ensure good lighting Set up safety equipment Fire extinguisher within reach Fire blanket accessible Safety glasses and apron on Open windows or turn on ventilation Arrange tools and materials Place everything within easy reach Set up double boiler on stove Have thermometer ready Pro Tip Lay out newspaper or parchment paper to catch any wax drips - cleanup will be much easier! Step 2: Prepare Your Container (5 minutes) \u00b6 Clean the jar thoroughly Wash with hot soapy water Dry completely (any moisture will cause problems) Remove any labels or adhesive residue Attach the wick Remove backing from wick sticker Press wick firmly to center of jar bottom Press down hard to ensure good adhesion Center the wick Use wick centering device or tape wick to pencil Rest pencil across jar rim to keep wick centered and straight Wick should be taut but not under tension Step 3: Measure and Melt Wax (15 minutes) \u00b6 Weigh your wax Place container on scale, zero/tare Add soy wax flakes until you reach 6 oz (170g) Use kitchen scale for accuracy Set up double boiler Fill larger pot with 2-3 inches of water Place smaller pot or pitcher inside Water should not touch bottom of inner container Heat on medium-low heat Melt the wax Add wax flakes to inner pot Stir occasionally with wooden spoon Monitor temperature with thermometer Target temperature: 170-180\u00b0F (77-82\u00b0C) Temperature Alert Never exceed 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) and never leave melting wax unattended! Step 4: Add Fragrance and Color (5 minutes) \u00b6 Check temperature Wait for wax to cool to 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) or below This is the maximum safe temperature for adding fragrance Add fragrance oil Measure 0.5 oz (1 tablespoon) fragrance oil Pour slowly into melted wax Stir gently for 1-2 minutes Avoid creating bubbles Add color (if using) Add 2-3 drops liquid dye or small chip of block dye Stir until completely dissolved Remember: less is more with color Fragrance Tip Start with less fragrance than you think you need. You can always add more in your next candle, but you can't remove excess fragrance. Step 5: Pour the Candle (10 minutes) \u00b6 Cool to pouring temperature Let wax cool to 135-145\u00b0F (57-63\u00b0C) This prevents shrinkage and ensures smooth tops Be patient - proper temperature is crucial Pour slowly and steadily Hold wick center device steady Pour wax down the side of jar (not directly onto wick) Fill to about 1/2 inch from top Leave some wax in melting pot (you'll need it later) Tap to release bubbles Gently tap sides of jar to release air bubbles Use heat gun briefly if needed to pop surface bubbles Don't overdo it - small bubbles usually disappear Step 6: First Cooling Period (45-60 minutes) \u00b6 Initial setup Place candle on flat, stable surface Keep wick centered as wax begins to set Avoid moving or jostling the candle Watch for sink holes As wax cools, it may create depressions around wick This is normal and expected Note any areas that need topping off Maintain workspace Keep melting pot warm (but not hot) Clean tools while wax is cooling Don't discard leftover wax yet Step 7: Top Off and Finish (15 minutes) \u00b6 Assess the surface Look for sink holes or depressions Check if surface is level and smooth Surface should be firm but not completely hard Reheat remaining wax Warm leftover wax to 145-150\u00b0F (63-66\u00b0C) You only need a small amount for topping Top off the candle Pour thin layer to fill any depressions Don't overfill - stay 1/2 inch from rim Use heat gun to smooth if needed Step 8: Final Cooling and Trimming (2-4 hours) \u00b6 Complete cooling Allow candle to cool completely (2-4 hours) Surface should be firm and cool to touch Don't rush this process Trim the wick Cut wick to 1/4 inch above wax surface Use sharp scissors or wick trimmer Remove any wick trimmings from wax Clean up the jar Wipe away any wax drips from outside of jar Clean any wax from rim Polish glass if needed Quality Check \u00b6 Your finished candle should meet these standards: Visual Inspection \u00b6 Smooth, level surface with minimal imperfections Centered wick standing straight No cracks or holes in wax surface Clean jar edges free of wax drips Even color throughout (if dyed) Safety Check \u00b6 Wick trimmed to 1/4 inch Proper wax level (1/2 inch from rim) Secure wick attachment (gently tug to test) No loose debris in wax Stable container sits level and secure Your First Burn Test \u00b6 Wait 24-48 hours before burning (allows fragrance to bind properly): Initial Burn (Critical) \u00b6 First burn is most important - burn for 2-3 hours or until wax pool reaches edges Monitor closely for proper flame size and behavior Check for even burn pool formation Note any smoking, flickering, or sooting Performance Evaluation \u00b6 Flame size : Should be steady, 1/2 to 1 inch tall Burn pool : Should reach container edges within 2-3 hours Scent throw : Should fill room with fragrance No smoking : Properly sized wick won't smoke when burning Common First-Time Issues and Solutions \u00b6 Surface Problems \u00b6 Issue : Rough or uneven surface Cause : Poured too hot or cooled too quickly Solution : Next time, pour at lower temperature (135\u00b0F) Issue : Large sink holes around wick Cause : Wax cooled too quickly or wick too large Solution : Pour second layer when first is partially set Burning Problems \u00b6 Issue : Tunneling (wax not melting to edges) Cause : Wick too small for container size Solution : Use larger wick in next candle Issue : Smoking or sooting Cause : Wick too large or flame too high Solution : Trim wick shorter or use smaller wick next time Scent Issues \u00b6 Issue : Weak scent throw Cause : Not enough fragrance or wrong fragrance type Solution : Increase fragrance load slightly or choose stronger fragrance Congratulations! \u00b6 You've just completed your first candle!
