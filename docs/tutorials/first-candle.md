!!! info "Before You Start"
**Prerequisites**: - Read and understand [Safety Protocols](../getting-started/safety.md) - Have all [required tools](../getting-started/tools.md) ready - Set up safe workspace with proper ventilation - Allow 2-3 hours for complete process (including cooling time)

## What You'll Create

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a beautiful 8 oz soy wax candle that:

-   Burns cleanly and evenly for 40-50 hours
-   Has excellent scent throw throughout the room
-   Looks professional and gift-worthy
-   Demonstrates all fundamental candle making techniques

## Materials Needed

### Wax and Wick

-   [ ] **6 oz soy wax flakes** (we'll make an 8 oz candle with ~6 oz of wax)
-   [ ] **1 medium cotton wick** (ECO-10 or CD-12 recommended for 3" diameter container)
-   [ ] **1 wick sticker** (small adhesive dot to secure wick)

### Container and Fragrance

-   [ ] **8 oz glass jar** (3" diameter opening ideal)
-   [ ] **0.5 oz fragrance oil** (about 1 tablespoon - 8% fragrance load)
-   [ ] Optional: **Candle dye** (2-3 drops liquid or small chip of block dye)

### Tools

-   [ ] **Double boiler setup** (large pot + smaller pot/pitcher)
-   [ ] **Digital thermometer** (instant-read type)
-   [ ] **Kitchen scale** (for precise measurements)
-   [ ] **Wooden spoon** or stirring stick
-   [ ] **Wick centering device** (pencils/clothespins work)
-   [ ] **Heat gun or hair dryer** (for smoothing top)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Workspace Preparation (5 minutes)

1. **Clear and clean your workspace**

    - Remove all clutter and flammable materials
    - Wipe down surfaces
    - Ensure good lighting

2. **Set up safety equipment**

    - Fire extinguisher within reach
    - Fire blanket accessible
    - Safety glasses and apron on
    - Open windows or turn on ventilation

3. **Arrange tools and materials**
    - Place everything within easy reach
    - Set up double boiler on stove
    - Have thermometer ready

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
Lay out newspaper or parchment paper to catch any wax drips - cleanup will be much easier!

### Step 2: Prepare Your Container (5 minutes)

1. **Clean the jar thoroughly**

    - Wash with hot soapy water
    - Dry completely (any moisture will cause problems)
    - Remove any labels or adhesive residue

2. **Attach the wick**

    - Remove backing from wick sticker
    - Press wick firmly to center of jar bottom
    - Press down hard to ensure good adhesion

3. **Center the wick**
    - Use wick centering device or tape wick to pencil
    - Rest pencil across jar rim to keep wick centered and straight
    - Wick should be taut but not under tension

### Step 3: Measure and Melt Wax (15 minutes)

1. **Weigh your wax**

    - Place container on scale, zero/tare
    - Add soy wax flakes until you reach 6 oz (170g)
    - Use kitchen scale for accuracy

2. **Set up double boiler**

    - Fill larger pot with 2-3 inches of water
    - Place smaller pot or pitcher inside
    - Water should not touch bottom of inner container
    - Heat on medium-low heat

3. **Melt the wax**
    - Add wax flakes to inner pot
    - Stir occasionally with wooden spoon
    - Monitor temperature with thermometer
    - Target temperature: 170-180°F (77-82°C)

!!! warning "Temperature Alert"
Never exceed 185°F (85°C) and never leave melting wax unattended!

### Step 4: Add Fragrance and Color (5 minutes)

1. **Check temperature**

    - Wait for wax to cool to 185°F (85°C) or below
    - This is the maximum safe temperature for adding fragrance

2. **Add fragrance oil**

    - Measure 0.5 oz (1 tablespoon) fragrance oil
    - Pour slowly into melted wax
    - Stir gently for 1-2 minutes
    - Avoid creating bubbles

3. **Add color (if using)**
    - Add 2-3 drops liquid dye or small chip of block dye
    - Stir until completely dissolved
    - Remember: less is more with color

!!! tip "Fragrance Tip"
Start with less fragrance than you think you need. You can always add more in your next candle, but you can't remove excess fragrance.

### Step 5: Pour the Candle (10 minutes)

1. **Cool to pouring temperature**

    - Let wax cool to 135-145°F (57-63°C)
    - This prevents shrinkage and ensures smooth tops
    - Be patient - proper temperature is crucial

2. **Pour slowly and steadily**

    - Hold wick center device steady
    - Pour wax down the side of jar (not directly onto wick)
    - Fill to about 1/2 inch from top
    - Leave some wax in melting pot (you'll need it later)

3. **Tap to release bubbles**
    - Gently tap sides of jar to release air bubbles
    - Use heat gun briefly if needed to pop surface bubbles
    - Don't overdo it - small bubbles usually disappear

### Step 6: First Cooling Period (45-60 minutes)

1. **Initial setup**

    - Place candle on flat, stable surface
    - Keep wick centered as wax begins to set
    - Avoid moving or jostling the candle

2. **Watch for sink holes**

    - As wax cools, it may create depressions around wick
    - This is normal and expected
    - Note any areas that need topping off

3. **Maintain workspace**
    - Keep melting pot warm (but not hot)
    - Clean tools while wax is cooling
    - Don't discard leftover wax yet

### Step 7: Top Off and Finish (15 minutes)

1. **Assess the surface**

    - Look for sink holes or depressions
    - Check if surface is level and smooth
    - Surface should be firm but not completely hard

2. **Reheat remaining wax**

    - Warm leftover wax to 145-150°F (63-66°C)
    - You only need a small amount for topping

3. **Top off the candle**
    - Pour thin layer to fill any depressions
    - Don't overfill - stay 1/2 inch from rim
    - Use heat gun to smooth if needed

### Step 8: Final Cooling and Trimming (2-4 hours)

1. **Complete cooling**

    - Allow candle to cool completely (2-4 hours)
    - Surface should be firm and cool to touch
    - Don't rush this process

2. **Trim the wick**

    - Cut wick to 1/4 inch above wax surface
    - Use sharp scissors or wick trimmer
    - Remove any wick trimmings from wax

3. **Clean up the jar**
    - Wipe away any wax drips from outside of jar
    - Clean any wax from rim
    - Polish glass if needed

## Quality Check

Your finished candle should meet these standards:

### Visual Inspection

-   [ ] **Smooth, level surface** with minimal imperfections
-   [ ] **Centered wick** standing straight
-   [ ] **No cracks or holes** in wax surface
-   [ ] **Clean jar edges** free of wax drips
-   [ ] **Even color** throughout (if dyed)

### Safety Check

-   [ ] **Wick trimmed to 1/4 inch**
-   [ ] **Proper wax level** (1/2 inch from rim)
-   [ ] **Secure wick attachment** (gently tug to test)
-   [ ] **No loose debris** in wax
-   [ ] **Stable container** sits level and secure

## Your First Burn Test

Wait 24-48 hours before burning (allows fragrance to bind properly):

### Initial Burn (Critical)

1. **First burn is most important** - burn for 2-3 hours or until wax pool reaches edges
2. **Monitor closely** for proper flame size and behavior
3. **Check for even burn pool** formation
4. **Note any smoking, flickering, or sooting**

### Performance Evaluation

-   **Flame size**: Should be steady, 1/2 to 1 inch tall
-   **Burn pool**: Should reach container edges within 2-3 hours
-   **Scent throw**: Should fill room with fragrance
-   **No smoking**: Properly sized wick won't smoke when burning

## Common First-Time Issues and Solutions

### Surface Problems

**Issue**: Rough or uneven surface

-   **Cause**: Poured too hot or cooled too quickly
-   **Solution**: Next time, pour at lower temperature (135°F)

**Issue**: Large sink holes around wick

-   **Cause**: Wax cooled too quickly or wick too large
-   **Solution**: Pour second layer when first is partially set

### Burning Problems

**Issue**: Tunneling (wax not melting to edges)

-   **Cause**: Wick too small for container size
-   **Solution**: Use larger wick in next candle

**Issue**: Smoking or sooting

-   **Cause**: Wick too large or flame too high
-   **Solution**: Trim wick shorter or use smaller wick next time

### Scent Issues

**Issue**: Weak scent throw

-   **Cause**: Not enough fragrance or wrong fragrance type
-   **Solution**: Increase fragrance load slightly or choose stronger fragrance
