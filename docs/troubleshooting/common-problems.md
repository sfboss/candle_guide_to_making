# Troubleshooting: Common Problems

!!! warning "Safety First"
Always work with proper ventilation, use heat-safe equipment, monitor temperatures closely, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby.

## Wet Spots (Container Pull-Away)

-   Cause: Glass temperature swings or poor adhesion
-   Fix: Pre-warm containers, pour at lower temps, cool slowly away from drafts

## Sinkholes / Craters

-   Cause: Rapid cooling or wax contraction
-   Fix: Heat gun to level surface, do a small second pour (2–3 mm)

## Frosting (Soy/Beeswax)

-   Cause: Natural crystal formation from temp changes
-   Fix: Pour slightly warmer, cool slowly, accept as natural character

## Tunneling

-   Cause: Wick too small or short initial burn
-   Fix: Up-size wick, ensure first burn melts to container edge (1–3 hours)

## Mushrooming / Soot

-   Cause: Wick too large or fragrance overload
-   Fix: Downsize wick, trim to 1/4" (6–7 mm), keep fragrance ≤ recommended %

## Poor Hot/Cold Throw

-   Cause: Low cure time, incorrect temp/fragrance type
-   Fix: Add FO at proper temp, cure 3–14 days, test different FO loads and wicks
