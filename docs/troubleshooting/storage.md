# Storage & Shipping

Proper storage and shipping preserve candle quality and safety.

## Storage

-   Store in a cool, dry place (60–75°F / 16–24°C), away from direct sunlight
-   Keep away from heat sources and ozone-producing appliances
-   Cover finished candles to prevent dust and scent cross-contamination
-   Label boxes with batch IDs and cure dates; use first-in-first-out (FIFO)

## Shipping

-   Use snug packaging with dividers; prevent glass-to-glass contact
-   Add temperature protection in hot/cold seasons (insulated mailers, cold packs if needed)
-   Include warning labels and burn instructions in each shipment
-   Test shipping by sending to yourself across zones to validate packing

## Returns & Damage

-   Photograph damage; document lot/batch
-   Improve void fill and corner protection for glass containers
-   Consider thicker-walled vessels for long-distance shipping
