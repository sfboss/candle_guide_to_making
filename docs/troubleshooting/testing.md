# Testing Methods

Reliable testing is essential for safety, performance, and consistency.

## Burn Test Protocol

1. Cure candles per wax guidance (typically 3–14 days)
2. Trim wick to 1/4" (6–7 mm)
3. Burn in a draft-free room (68–75°F / 20–24°C)
4. Record melt pool diameter/depth at 1, 2, and 3 hours
5. Log flame height, flicker, soot, and mushrooming
6. Extinguish, cool fully, repeat over multiple cycles

## Wick Testing Matrix

-   Variables: wick series/size, wax type, FO %, container diameter
-   Test 2–3 adjacent sizes per series
-   Select size that reaches full melt pool in 2–3 burns without overheating

## Fragrance & Additives

-   Add FO at recommended temp range for wax
-   Start at 6–8% and adjust ±2% based on throw and stability
-   Avoid exceeding manufacturer max for safety/soot

## Documentation Template

-   Batch ID, date, wax lot, FO %, wick code
-   Pour temp, ambient temp, container type
-   Observations per burn cycle and photos
