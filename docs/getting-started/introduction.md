    - **Novelty Shapes**: Using custom molds

    **Various Waxes**: Depends on specific application

## Understanding the Science

### The Combustion Process

When you light a candle:

1. **Heat melts wax** near the wick
2. **Liquid wax is drawn up** the wick by capillary action
3. **Heat vaporizes the wax** at the tip of the wick
4. **Vaporized wax burns**, creating heat and light
5. **The process continues** as long as fuel (wax) and oxygen are available

### Key Variables That Affect Performance

!!! info "Critical Factors"

    **Wick Size**: Too small = tunneling, too large = smoking and sooting

    **Wax Type**: Different waxes have different burning characteristics

    **Fragrance Load**: Too much fragrance can affect burning and safety

    **Container Size**: Affects heat retention and burn pool formation

    **Environment**: Drafts, temperature, and humidity all impact performance

## Organic vs. Conventional Materials

### Why Choose Organic/Natural Materials?
