# Safety First: Essential Candle Making Safety

!!! danger "Critical Safety Notice"
Candle making involves working with hot wax (up to 185°F/85°C), open flames, and potentially hazardous materials. **Read this entire section before beginning** and always follow all safety protocols.

Safety is the foundation of successful candle making. Whether you're making one candle or running a business, these protocols will protect you, your family, and your property.

## Workspace Safety Setup

### Essential Safety Equipment

**Fire Safety** (Non-negotiable):

-   [ ] **Fire extinguisher** (Class B for flammable liquids) within easy reach
-   [ ] **Smoke detector** in working order
-   [ ] **Fire blanket** for smothering small fires
-   [ ] **Exit plan** - know your escape route

**Personal Protection**:

-   [ ] **Safety glasses** to protect from wax splatter
-   [ ] **Heat-resistant gloves** for handling hot equipment
-   [ ] **Apron or old clothes** to protect from wax spills
-   [ ] **Closed-toe shoes** - never sandals or bare feet

**Ventilation Requirements**:

-   [ ] **Proper ventilation** - open windows or use exhaust fan
-   [ ] **Avoid small, enclosed spaces** - basements without ventilation are dangerous
-   [ ] **Consider air purifier** if working indoors frequently

### Workspace Preparation

**Clear Work Area**:

-   Remove all flammable materials from workspace
-   Keep pets and children away from work area
-   Ensure adequate lighting for safe work
-   Have clean, flat, heat-resistant work surface

**Emergency Preparedness**:

-   Keep first aid kit accessible
-   Have phone nearby for emergencies
-   Know location of nearest hospital
-   Never work alone if possible

## Temperature Safety

### Understanding Wax Temperatures

Different waxes have different safe temperature ranges:

=== "Soy Wax"

    - **Melting Point**: 120-180°F (49-82°C)
    - **Max Safe Temp**: 185°F (85°C)
    - **Pouring Temp**: 135-145°F (57-63°C)
    - **Adding Fragrance**: 185°F (85°C) or below

=== "Beeswax"

    - **Melting Point**: 144-147°F (62-64°C)
    - **Max Safe Temp**: 185°F (85°C)
    - **Pouring Temp**: 150-160°F (66-71°C)
    - **Adding Fragrance**: 160°F (71°C) or below

=== "Coconut Wax"

    - **Melting Point**: 76°F (24°C)
    - **Max Safe Temp**: 185°F (85°C)
    - **Pouring Temp**: 120-130°F (49-54°C)
    - **Adding Fragrance**: 160°F (71°C) or below

### Temperature Safety Rules

!!! warning "Critical Temperature Rules"

    **Never exceed 200°F (93°C)** - wax can ignite at high temperatures

    **Use reliable thermometer** - digital instant-read recommended

    **Monitor constantly** - never leave heating wax unattended

    **Heat slowly and evenly** - rapid heating can cause dangerous hot spots

## Equipment Safety

### Double Boiler Method (Recommended)

-   Use dedicated double boiler or improvised version
-   Never allow water to boil dry
-   Keep water level consistent
-   Never allow water to mix with wax

### Alternative Heating Methods

**Electric Wax Melter** (Professional option):

-   Temperature controlled
-   Safer than stovetop methods
-   More consistent results
-   Worth investment for regular candle making

**Microwave** (Not recommended for beginners):

-   Uneven heating creates hot spots
-   Easy to overheat wax
-   Difficult to monitor temperature
-   Use only if experienced and with great caution

!!! danger "Never Use These Methods" - **Direct flame heating** (stovetop burner directly under wax pot) - **Oven heating** (fire hazard and poor temperature control) - **Hot plates** without temperature control - **Makeshift heating methods**

## Chemical Safety

### Fragrance Oil Safety

-   **Skin contact**: Wear gloves, avoid direct skin contact
-   **Inhalation**: Use in well-ventilated area, avoid breathing vapors
-   **Eye contact**: Wear safety glasses, have eye wash station
-   **Storage**: Keep in cool, dark place, away from heat sources

### Colorant Safety

-   **Use only candle-safe dyes** - never use crayons or food coloring
-   **Follow concentration guidelines** - usually 0.1-0.5% by weight
-   **Test in small batches** - some colors affect burning

### Essential Oil Considerations

-   **Maximum safe concentration**: Usually 6-10% for most essential oils
-   **Skin sensitizers**: Some oils can cause allergic reactions
-   **Flammability**: Many essential oils are highly flammable
-   **Research each oil**: Not all essential oils are safe for candles

## Fire Safety Protocols

### Prevention

-   **Never leave melting wax unattended**
-   **Keep workspace clear of flammable materials**
-   **Use proper temperature controls**
-   **Have fire safety equipment ready**
-   **Work in well-ventilated area**

### If Wax Catches Fire

!!! danger "Wax Fire Emergency Protocol"

    **DO**:
    - Turn off heat source immediately
    - Cover flames with lid to smother (if safe to do so)
    - Use Class B fire extinguisher
    - Call fire department if fire spreads
    - Evacuate if fire cannot be controlled

    **DON'T**:
    - Never use water on wax fire (spreads burning wax)
    - Don't move burning pot (spreads fire)
    - Don't use flour or sugar (highly flammable)
    - Don't panic - follow protocols calmly

### Burn Treatment

**For minor wax burns**:

1. Remove from heat source immediately
2. Cool with cold water for 10-15 minutes
3. Do not remove hardened wax from skin
4. Apply burn gel or aloe vera
5. Seek medical attention if severe

**For serious burns**:

-   Call emergency services immediately
-   Do not attempt to remove wax from skin
-   Cover with clean, dry cloth
-   Do not apply ice or butter

## Electrical Safety

### Power Tool Safety

-   **Inspect cords** before each use
-   **Keep electrical equipment** away from water and wax
-   **Use GFCI outlets** in areas where water is present
-   **Unplug when not in use**

### Heat Gun Safety

-   Never point heat gun at people or flammable materials
-   Allow to cool completely before storing
-   Use only for intended candle making purposes
-   Keep cord away from heat sources

## Child and Pet Safety

### Keep Away from Work Area

-   **Children**: Never allow children in candle making area during work
-   **Pets**: Hot wax can seriously injure pets - keep them away
